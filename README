This demo is run via "mvn test".  It shows how to use Squeryl (a Scala ORM) for accessing a postgres database.
It assumes postgres is up and running and that the sql in the sql.txt file has been run in the database. It also has
tests which demonstrate the very-fast asynchronous Spray rest client.  All tests are harnessed in ScalaTest.
